//JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Part 1

// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
let markMass = 78;
let markHeight = 1.69;
let johnMass = 92;
let johnHeight = 1.95;
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
let markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
let johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
let markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;
if (markHigherBMI) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI}) is higher than John's BMI (${johnBMI})`);
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI}) is higher than Mark's BMI (${markBMI})`);
}
